**Predicting the Total Number of Registered Electric Vehicles in Texas for 2022 Using Machine Learning Approach** <br>
All the csv files and the codes have been uploaded here<br>

Final code for random forest model at county level - RF_Bag_GBM_county.R <br> 
Many data cleaning steps were done in the same files <br>
Final code for random forest at zip level - RF_zip.R  <br>
Final code for neural network model - neural_network_zip.R  <br>
Final linear model - linear model.R <br>
Code for cleaning the energy profile data - energy_profile_data_clean.R <br>
Code for cleaning other dataset(some dataset cleaning done in the individual models only) - Data_cleaning.R
